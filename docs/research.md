# Research on how to build bildit

## Plugin Repositories

* [easeway](https://github.com/easeway/js-plugins): It looks exactly like what I need. Very simple too.

## Message Queue

* [automattic/queue](https://github.com/Automattic/kue): based on redis

## Saas version of bildit

* [external load balancer](https://traefik.io/): looks interesting. alternative to builtin kubernetes one
* [deployment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/exoframe): simple deployment of projects
* [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/): alternative to AWS? In the end, all that matters is price.
