## Continuation

## CLI and productization

1. Refactor to simplify by removing all the bullshit
1. Support grouping of tests (so I can disable/enable a group)
1. Support building without marking as built (so I can reinstall without it thinking everything is fine),
   and make it the default when disabling any step
1. Fix bug where artifactrc is mostly ignored
1. Make the output of bilt test output be tty
1. Support `allOutput` from CLI
