# Build configurations

In which we define precisely what build configurations are, and how to use them.

## What are build configurations

Build configurations are a JSON where you can define how your build looks like: how
you build each package and what should be done before all packages are built, and after them.
While there is a default build configuration, which should be OK for most monorepo, some
projects have some special needs that make them write their own build configurations.

For example, a project may have a special npm script that you want to run for each package, or
maybe send an HTTP request to a web service that keeps track of all published packages.

Or maybe you want to have two different kind of jobs: a `build` job and a `deployment` job.

## Using build configurations

Build configurations are defined in the `.biltrc.json`, in the property
[`buildConfiguration`](./reference.md#build-configuration). It can either be
the JSON of the build configuration, or a string containing the path to the build configuration.

If it is a path, the file can either be a JSON, a JS module, or a YAML file
(loaded using [cosmiconfig](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cosmiconfig)).

When using the CLI, it will look for the job `build` when building the packages, unless
you use another command, like:

```sh
bilt deploy ./ms-a
```

Which runs the `deploy` job in your build configuration.

## Build configuration reference

This is a reference to the build configuration object. You can see the definition
in Typescript (as embedded in JSDoc) [here](./packages/build-with-configuration/src/types.js).

### The `BuildConfiguration` object

* A build configuration is a JSON object with the following properties:

* `jobs`: the only property in the object. It is a `Jobs` object.
* `extends`: a path to a file that is another build configuration. The CLI will look
  for a job in the `extends` build configuration if it is not found in the main one.

  The special string value `#default` means that this build configuration extends the default one.

### The `Jobs` object

An object who's keys are `jobId`-s, and who's values are `Job` objects.

* `jobId`-s. Any string is OK, but they are referenced from the command line, so they are
  typically "standard simple ASCII with no weird characters".

  When using the `bilt` CLI, you can specify the job to run by specifying its `jobId`. If not
  specified, `bilt` runs the job under the "`build`" `jobId`.

## The `Job` object

An object with the following properties:

* `steps`: an object with three optional properties:
  `before`: an array of `Step` objects defining the steps to execute _before_ building all the
  packages (but only if there are any packages to build)
  `after`: an array of `Step` objects defining the steps to execute _after_ building all the
  packages (but only if at least one of the packages built succesfully)
  `during`: the steps to run for each package. These are the steps for the ["package build"](./concepts.md#build)

### The `Step` object

An object with the following properties:

* `name`: the name of the step (will be shown in the CLI before running the step)
* `run`: the shell command to execute for the step
* `enableOption`: a string, or an array of strings that defines the CLI options that
  enable or disable this step (the default is `true`: to enable). The step will not execute
  if all of the options that are set are explicitly set to `false`, or if no options are set at all.
* `parameterOption`: a string, or an array of strings, that define parameters to be passed to the
  `run` command. The `run` command will receive them in the form of
  `BILT_OPTION_${constantCase(option)}`, e.g. a parameter option `foo-bar` will be passed as
  `BILT_OPTION_FOO_BAR`.
* `condition`: can be:
  * A boolean: defines whether to execute this step or not.
  * A function: [evaluated](#evaluating-functions-inside-the-build-configuration) whose return
    defines whether to execute this step or not. Passing a function is available only
    when the build configuration is a JS module.
  * A string: `eval`-ed and assumed to be a function that is
    [evaluated](#evaluating-functions-inside-the-build-configuration) whose return
    defines whether to execute this step or not.
* `env`: an object that defines additional environment variables passed to the `run` command.

  The key is the environment variable name, and the value can be:
  * A string: defines the environment variable value.
  * A function: [evaluated](#evaluating-functions-inside-the-build-configuration) whose return
    defines the environment variable value. Passing a function is available only
    when the build configuration is a JS module.
  * An object with a `function` string property: `eval`-ed and assumed to be a function that is
    [evaluated](#evaluating-functions-inside-the-build-configuration) whose return
    defines the environment variable value.

### Evaluating functions inside the build configuration

A function that is evaluated for any purpose in the build configuration is evaluated thus:

* It is treated as an async function, but sync functions are OK too.
* It is passed an object with the following properties:
  * `directory`: the directory (full path) of the package, or in the case of steps in
    the `before` or `after` phases, the root directory (full path) of the monorepo.
  * `biltin`: an object that includes builtin helper functions ("biltin", get it?) that
    can help your steps. The `biltin` object is structured as a set of namespaces with functions
    in them. Each namespace is an object where each property is a function. Currently, the only
    namespace is `npm`, and it includes the following functions:
    * `nextVersion`: an async function that accepts a directory of a package and returns the
      next version of the package, as defined [here](./how-bilt-works.md#version-increment-how).

## Sample Build Configuration with all the features

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    steps:
      before:
        - name: 'git pull'
          enableOption: ['pull', 'git']
          run: 'git pull --rebase --autostash'

      after:
        - name: 'git commit'
          enableOption: ['commit', 'git']
          parameterOption: 'message'
          run: 'git commit --allow-empty -m "$BILT_OPTION_MESSAGE"'

      during:
        - name: 'npm install'
          enableOption: 'install'
          run: 'npm install'
        - name: 'increment version'
          enableOption: 'publish'
          run: "npm version $NEXT_VERSION --allow-same-version --no-git-tag-version"
          env:
            NEXT_VERSION:
              function: |
                async ({directory, biltin}) => {
                  return await biltin.npm.nextVersion(directory)
                }
        - name: 'test'
          run: 'npm run test'
          enableOption: 'test'
          condition:
            function: |
              async ({directory}) => {
                const packageJson = JSON.parse(await require('fs').promises.readFile(directory + "/package.json"))

                return (packageJson.scripts || {}).test
              }
        - name: 'npm publish'
          enableOption: 'publish'
          run: 'npm publish --access=$ACCESS'
          condition:
            function: |
              async ({directory}) => {
                const packageJson = JSON.parse(await require('fs').promises.readFile(directory + "/package.json"))

                return !packageJson.private
              }
          env:
            ACCESS:
              function: |
                async ({directory}) => {
                  const packageJson = JSON.parse(await require('fs').promises.readFile(directory + "/package.json"))

                  const isPublic = (packageJson.publishConfig || {}).access !== 'restricted'

                  return isPublic ? 'public' : 'restricted'
                }
        - name: 'stage files'
          enableOption: ['stage']
          run: 'git add .'
```

## The default build configuration

Before all of the package builds:

1. `git pull --rebase --autostash`: to pull all changes from the remote repository before building.

For each package:

1. `npm install` ensures all dependencies are installed
1. `npm update` updates all the dependencies.
    This is especially important in Bilt moonorepos, as it updates
    the dependencies to the other packages in the monorepo. Without `npm update`, packages
    will have outdated dependencies on the other packages in a monorepo.
1. _Increment_ version: to update the version of the package so it can be published.
   See [this](./how-bilt-works.md#version-increment-how) for more information.
1. `npm audit fix`. Because we're security conscious!
   (See [Snyk](https://snyk.io) for a more powerful alternative.)
1. `npm run build`: build the source code. For example transpile the code, bundle it,
   or build a docker image. This runs only if a `build` script exists in the `package.json`.
1. `npm test`: because we have tests, right? ðŸ˜‰ Will skip if no `test` script exists
1. `npm publish`: publishes the package

After this, Bilt also runs `git add .` to add all the files to be commited.

After all of the package builds:

1. `git commit -m "commit message"`: commit all the added files (with the addition of the
   `[bilt artifacts]` text to the commit message, as described above).
2. `git push`: pushes changes to the remote repository.

### Build options for default build configuration

All of these build options have a default of `true`, and are the options specified in the
default build configuration

* `--pull`: enables disables "pull" when building
* `--push`: enables disables "push" when building
* `--commit`: enables disables "commit" when building
* `--install`: enables disables "install" when building
* `--update`: enables disables "update" when building
* `--audit`: enables disables "audit" when building
* `--build`: enables disables "build" when building
* `--test`: enables disables "test" when building
* `--publish`: enables disables "publish" when building
* `--git`: no-git disables push/pull/commit together (even if they are defaults in the
  `.biltrc.json`), unless they are explicitly specified in the command line
