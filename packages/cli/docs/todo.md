# TODO

1. How do we deal with downstream packages that are built, but their upstream ones haven't?
   (for example because of a bug)

   Ideally, in the next build, we'd want to build all the upstreams from the already built packages.

## Rewrite CLI

1. More biltrc tests
1. Write documentation in readme.
1. Build steps come from biltrc.
